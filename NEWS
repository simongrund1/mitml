                   procedures)

* plot:            additional value for print argument ("beta2", denoting the
                   regression coefficients of the cluster-level imputation
                   model)

                   included Rhat and autocorrelation at lag k in the posterior
                   summary; for trace="burnin", the summary is now calculated

                   - includes adjustments in mitml.complete as well as the

                   - includes minor changes in the interpretation of the formula
                     and type arguments
                   - adds a few slots to the 'mitml' object class
