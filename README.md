#### Tools for multiple imputation in multilevel modeling

This [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package provides tools for multiple imputation of missing data in multilevel modeling.
It includes a user-friendly interface to the packages `pan` and `jomo`, and several functions for visualization, data management, and the analysis of multiply imputed data sets.

The purpose of `mitml` is to provide users with a set of effective and user-friendly tools for multiple imputation of multilevel data without requiring advanced knowledge of its statistical underpinnings.
Examples and additional information can be found in the official [documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mitml/mitml.pdf) of the package and in the [Wiki](https://github.com/simongrund1/mitml/wiki) pages on GitHub.

If you use `mitml` and have suggestions for improvement, please email me (see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mitml)) or file an [issue](https://github.com/simongrund1/mitml/issues) at the GitHub repository.
